# PCA-analysis-of-mPFC-neurons
The medial prefrontal cortex is implicated in the adaptation of behaviour in response to a changing environment. However, it is not clear how environmental factors are represented in the medial prefrontal cortex and whether the changes in these representation are related to behaviour adaptation and learning. To investigate this, we utilised the PCA dimensionality reduction techniques to analyse neural data of rats performing Y-maze task where the rules of the environment were systematically changed. Principal component analysis revealed neural dynamics changes both within and across the trials related to expectation of reward, engagement to the task, decision point and learning.
